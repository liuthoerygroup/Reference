We show that these BOPs allow the concept of single, double, triple and conjugate bonds in carbon systems to be quantified, so that they provide the first 'classical' interatomic potentials that handle both structural differentiation and radical formation naturally within their remit. Finally, we indicate that this recently developed BOP formalism allows explicit, analytic expressions for the environmental dependence of the TB bond integrals to be derived, thereby providing a systematic methodology for bridging from the electronic to atomistic modelling hierarchies},

We development a shell model to study PbTiO/sub 3/, which is an important component in many piezoelectric solid solutions. With parameters completely adjusted to available first principle calculations, the model describes the temperature behavior of the system in good agreement with experiments. At P=0, however, the potential gives a antiferrodistortive instability, which coexists with the ferroelectric distortion. The instability disappears at a pressure of 0.5 GPa},

  abstract  = {A simple ten-parameter interatomic potential model is described that is capable of accurately reproducing the static and dynamical properties of complex oxides. The accuracy of this model stems from the crystal-chemical bond-valence theory of ionic and covalent bonding. The development of a specific variant of this model for ferroelectric PbTiO/sub 3/ (PT) is discussed in detail, and comparison of the model is made with density functional theory computations and with experimental data. Bond-valence molecular dynamics (BVMD) simulations for PT show a ferroelectric transition at 575 K. The BVMD model correctly reproduces the mixed order-disorder and displacive phase transition character, the magnitudes of cation displacements in the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases, and the energy of 180 degrees domain walls. The success of this simple and physically motivated model makes the simulation of extended defects tractable in PT and other complex oxides},

We find that the directions and magnitudes of cation displacement can be explained by an interplay of cation-oxygen bonding, electrostatic dipole-dipole interactions, and short-range direct and through oxygen Pb-B-cation repulsive interactions. We find that the Zn ions move off center in the PZN-PT system, which also enables larger Pb and Nb/Ti displacements. The off-centering behavior of Zn lessens Pb-B-cation repulsion, leading to relaxor-to-ferroelectric and rhombohedral-to-tetragonal phase transitions at low PbTiO/sub 3/ content in the PZN-PT system. We also show that a simple quadratic relationship exists between Pb and B-cation displacements and the temperature maximum of the dielectric constant, thus linking the enhanced displacements in PZN-PT systems with the higher transition temperatures},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic devices based on lead iodide perovskite films have seen rapid advancements, recently achieving an impressive 17.9\% certified solar power conversion efficiency. Reports have consistently emphasized that the specific choice of growth conditions and chemical precursors is central to achieving superior performance from these materials; yet the roles and mechanisms underlying the selection of materials processing route is poorly understood. Here we show that films grown under iodine-rich conditions are prone to a high density of deep electronic traps (recombination centers), while the use of a chloride precursor avoids the formation of key defects (Pb atom substituted by I) responsible for short diffusion lengths and poor photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, the lowest-energy surfaces of perovskite crystals are found to be entirely trap-free, preserving both electron and hole delocalization to a remarkable degree, helping to account for explaining the success of polycrystalline perovskite films. We construct perovskite films from I-poor conditions using a lead acetate precursor, and our measurement of a long (600 ? 40 nm) diffusion length confirms this new picture of the importance of growth conditions.},

Crystal formation stages of the perovskites have been demonstrated for the first time. Shape changes of such perovskites are accompanied by transition in their crystal structures and variation of optical properties. Herein, a new trigonal phase for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 has been observed with a rod-like morphology. Photoemission study indicates a significant red shift in the perovskite nanoparticles, compared to that of the rod-like nanocrystals. This solvent-controlled formation of polymorphic phases provide an additional approach for controlling the optical properties of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 for various optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract = {Organic???inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have been receiving considerable attention due to their promising applications in many optoelectronic fields. However, some of the fundamental properties of perovskite materials are still disputed, because most of them are derived from a thin-film state. To comprehend the intrinsic characteristics in a single crystal, herein we report, for the first time, the bulk crystal growth of CH3NH3PbI3. Single crystals of tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 with dimensions of 10 mm ?? 10 mm ?? 8 mm were grown by a temperature-lowering method in HI solution. Studies in to the refinement and orientations of the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal structure were conducted based on a high quality crystal. The absorption edge of a CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal was located at about 836 nm, indicating that the band gap of CH3NH3PbI3 is approximately 1.48 eV, which is close to the theoretical results and smaller than those derived from polycrystalline and thin-films.

  abstract  = {Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites have been widely used as absorbers on mesoporous TiO2 films as well as thin films in planar heterojunction solar cells{,} yielding very high photovoltaic conversion efficiencies. Both the addition of chloride and sequential deposition methods were successfully employed to enhance the photovoltaic performance. Here{,} both approaches are combined in a sequential method by spincoating PbCl2 + PbI2 on a mesoporous TiO2 film followed by the perovskite transformation. The role of Cl in determining the optical{,} electrical{,} structural and morphological properties is correlated with the photovoltaic performance. The highest photovoltaic efficiency of 14.15% with the Voc{,} FF and Jsc being 1.09 V{,} 0.65 and 19.91 mA cm-2 respectively was achieved with 10 mol% of PbCl2 addition due to an increase of the film conductivity induced by a better perovskite morphology. This is linked to an improvement of the hysteresis and reproducibility of the solar cells.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectricity has been believed to be an important but controversial origin of the excellent photovoltaic performance of organometal trihalide perovskites (OTPs). Here we investigate the ferroelectricity of a prototype OTP, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), both theoretically and experimentally. Our first-principles calculations based on 3-D periodic boundary conditions reveal that a ferroelectric structure with polarization of ?8 ?C/cm2 is the globally stable one among all possible tetragonal structures; however, experimentally no room-temperature ferroelectricity is observed by using polarization?electric field hysteresis measurements and piezoresponse force microscopy. The discrepancy between our theoretical and experimental results is attributed to the dynamic orientational disorder of MA+ groups and the semiconducting nature of MAPbI3 at room temperature. Therefore, we conclude that MAPbI3 is not ferroelectric at room temperature; however, it is possible to induce and experimentally observe apparent ferroelectric behavior through our proposed ways. Our results clarify the controversy of the ferroelectricity in MAPbI3 and also provide valuable guidance for future studies on this active topic.},

  abstract = {Organic?inorganic lead trihalide perovskites have emerged as an outstanding photovoltaic material that demonstrated a high 17.9\% conversion efficiency of sunlight to electricity in a short time. We have found a giant dielectric constant (GDC) phenomenon in these materials consisting on a low frequency dielectric constant in the dark of the order of ?0 = 1000. We also found an unprecedented behavior in which ?0 further increases under illumination or by charge injection at applied bias. We observe that ?0 increases nearly linearly with the illumination intensity up to an additional factor 1000 under 1 sun. Measurement of a variety of samples of different morphologies, compositions, and different types of contacts shows that the GDC is an intrinsic property of MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+). We hypothesize that the large dielectric response is induced by structural fluctuations. Photoinduced carriers modify the local unit cell equilibrium and change the polarizability, assisted by the freedom of rotation of MA. The study opens a way for the understanding of a key aspect of the photovoltaic operation of high efficiency perovskite solar cells.},

  abstract  = {The power conversion efficiency of hybrid solid-state solar
 cells has more than doubled from 7 to 15% over the past year. This
 is largely as a result of the incorporation of organometallic
 trihalide perovskite absorbers into these devices. But, as
 promising as this development is, long-term operational stability
 is just as important as initial conversion efficiency when it
 comes to the development of practical solid-state solar cells.
 Here we identify a critical instability in mesoporous
 TiO2-sensitized solar cells arising from light-induced desorption
 of surface-adsorbed oxygen. We show that this instability does not
 arise in mesoporous TiO2-free mesosuperstructured solar cells.
 Moreover, our TiO2-free cells deliver stable photocurrent for over
 1,000?h continuous exposure and operation under full
 spectrum simulated sunlight.},

However{,} our study shows that TBP can corrode the perovskite absorption layer (CH3NH3PbI3) and interfere with the stability of the solar cells. To address this problem{,} montmorillonite (MMT) was used to form a buffer layer on top of the hole transport layer. XRD results revealed that TBP was intercalated in the MMT structure and UV-vis spectroscopy analysis revealed that this structure could prevent the corrosion of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. Moreover{,} the MMT buffer layer could limit charge recombination in the solar cells. A delayed corrosion led to an increased current density owing to enhanced absorption{,} while a reduced charge recombination led to an increased fill factor and open voltage circuit values. Consequently{,} the corresponding efficiency largely increased from 9.0% to 11.9%{,} with an improvement of 32.2%. Therefore{,} the application of MMT as a bifunctional buffer coating layer on the hole transport layer is a useful strategy for preparing highly efficient hybrid perovskite solar cells with anti-corrosion and delayed charge recombination properties.},

  abstract   = {Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) cells of the design FTO/sTiO2/mpTiO2/MAPI/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide, sTiO2 indicates solid-TiO2, and mpTiO2 is mesoporous TiO2, are studied using transient photovoltage (TPV), differential capacitance, charge extraction, current interrupt, and chronophotoamperometry. We show that in mpTiO2/MAPI cells there are two kinds of extractable charge stored under operation: a capacitive electronic charge (?0.2 ?C/cm2) and another, larger charge (40 ?C/cm2), possibly related to mobile ions. Transient photovoltage decays are strongly double exponential with two time constants that differ by a factor of ?5, independent of bias light intensity. The fast decay (?1 ?s at 1 sun) is assigned to the predominant charge recombination pathway in the cell. We examine and reject the possibility that the fast decay is due to ferroelectric relaxation or to the bulk photovoltaic effect. Like many MAPI solar cells, the studied cells show significant J?V hysteresis. Capacitance vs open circuit voltage (Voc) data indicate that the hysteresis involves a change in internal potential gradients, likely a shift in band offset at the TiO2/MAPI interface. The TPV results show that the Voc hysteresis is not due to a change in recombination rate constant. Calculation of recombination flux at Voc suggests that the hysteresis is also not due to an increase in charge separation efficiency and that charge generation is not a function of applied bias. We also show that the J?V hysteresis is not a light driven effect but is caused by exposure to electrical bias, light or dark.},

  abstract = {The last two years have seen the unprecedentedly rapid emergence of a new class of solar cells, based on hybrid organic???inorganic halide perovskites. The success of this class of materials is due to their outstanding photoelectrochemical properties coupled to their low cost, mainly solution-based, fabrication techniques. Solution processed materials are however often characterized by an inherent flexible structure, which is hardly mapped into a single local minimum energy structure. In this perspective, we report on the interplay between structural and electronic properties of hybrid lead iodide perovskites investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, which allow the dynamical simulation of disordered systems at finite temperature. We compare the prototypical MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium) perovskite in its cubic and tetragonal structure with the trigonal phase of FAPbI3 (FA = formamidinium), investigating different starting arrangements of the organic cations. Despite the relatively short time scale amenable to AIMD, typically a few tens of ps, this analysis demonstrates the sizable structural flexibility of this class of materials, showing that the instantaneous structure could significantly differ from the time and thermal averaged structure. We also highlight the importance of the organic???inorganic interactions in determining the fluxional properties of this class of materials. A peculiar spatial localization of the valence and conduction band edges is also found, with a dynamics in the range of 0.1 ps, which is associated with the positional dynamics of the organic cations within the cubo-octahedral perovskite cage. This asymmetry in the spatial localization of the band edges is expected to ease exciton dissociation and assist the initial stages of charge separation, possibly constituting one of the key factors for the impressive photovoltaic performances of hybrid lead-iodide perovskites.},

We further show that despite a large bandgap of 2.2 eV, all dominant defects in CH3NH3PbBr3 create shallow levels, which partially explains the ultra-high open-circuit voltages achieved by CH3NH3PbBr3-based thin-film solar cells. Our results suggest that the perovskite CH3NH3PbBr3 can be both an excellent solar cell absorber and a promising low-cost hole-transport material for lead halide perovskite solar cells.},

This is likely to continue to rise, but in the development of these solar cells there are unusual characteristics that have arisen, specifically an anomalous hysteresis in the current?voltage curves. We identify this phenomenon and show some examples of factors that make the hysteresis more or less extreme. We also demonstrate stabilized power output under working conditions and suggest that this is a useful parameter to present, alongside the current-voltage scan derived power conversion efficiency. We hypothesize three possible origins of the effect and discuss its implications on device efficiency and future research directions.

We demonstrate, through quantum mechanical calculations, that an origin of this phenomenon is a prevalence of ionic over electronic disorder in stoichiometric materials. Schottky defect formation provides a mechanism to self-regulate the concentration of charge carriers through ionic compensation of charged point defects. The equilibrium charged vacancy concentration is predicted to exceed 0.4???\% at room temperature. This behavior, which goes against established defect conventions for inorganic semiconductors, has implications for photovoltaic performance.},

  abstract  = {Organolead trihalide perovskite (OTP) materials are emerging as naturally abundant materials for low-cost, solution-processed and highly efficient solar cells. Here, we show that, in OTP-based photovoltaic devices with vertical and lateral cell configurations, the photocurrent direction can be switched repeatedly by applying a small electric field of {\textless}1 V ??m???1. The switchable photocurrent, generally observed in devices based on ferroelectric materials, reached 20.1 mA cm???2 under one sun illumination in OTP devices with a vertical architecture, which is four orders of magnitude larger than that measured in other ferroelectric photovoltaic devices. This field-switchable photovoltaic effect can be explained by the formation of reversible p???i???n structures induced by ion drift in the perovskite layer. The demonstration of switchable OTP photovoltaics and electric-field-manipulated doping paves the way for innovative solar cell designs and for the exploitation of OTP materials in electrically and optically readable memristors and circuits.},

  abstract   = {Organic?inorganic methylammonium lead halide perovskites have recently emerged as promising solar photovoltaic absorbers. In this Feature Article, we review our theoretical understanding of the superior photovoltaic properties, such as the extremely high optical absorption coefficient and very long carrier diffusion length of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites through first-principles theory. We elucidate that the superior photovoltaic properties are attributed to the combination of direct band gap p?p transitions enabled by the Pb lone-pair s orbitals and perovskite symmetry, high iconicity, large lattice constant, and strong antibonding coupling between Pb lone-pair s and I p orbitals. We show that CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits intrinsic ambipolar self-doping behavior with conductivities tunable from p-type to n-type via controlling the growth conditions. We show that the p-type conductivity can be further improved by incorporating some group IA, IB, or VIA elements at I-rich/Pb-poor growth conditions. However, the n-type conductivity cannot be improved under thermal equilibrium growth conditions through extrinsic doping due to the compensation from intrinsic point defects.},

The efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells has increased rapidly, from 3.8\% in 2009 to 19.3\% in 2014, by using the all-solid-state thin-film architecture and engineering cell structures with mixed-halide perovskites. The emergence of perovskite solar cells revolutionized the field not only because of their rapidly increased efficiency, but also flexibility in material growth and architecture. The superior performance of the perovskite solar cells suggested that perovskite materials possess intrinsically unique properties. In this review, we summarize recent theoretical investigations into the structural, electrical, and optical properties of halide perovskite materials in relation to their applications in solar cells. We also discuss some current challenges of using perovskites in solar cells, along with possible theoretical solutions.},
